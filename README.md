# CineVerse - Movie & TV Explorer

## Overview

CineVerse is a responsive web application that allows users to explore movies and TV shows with advanced filtering, search functionality, and a personal watchlist system. The application integrates with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide real-time movie data and features a modern, animated user interface with dark theme styling. Users can browse trending content, filter by genres and regions, and maintain a personal watchlist with persistent storage.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation** - No frameworks used, focusing on vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance
- **Component-based design** - Modular JavaScript classes (CineVerse, AnimationController, MovieAPI, WishlistManager) handle different aspects of functionality
- **Responsive grid layouts** - CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive movie/show displays across devices
- **CSS custom properties** - Centralized theming system with dark mode color scheme
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced features layer on top

### Data Management
- **localStorage-based persistence** - Watchlist and user preferences stored locally in browser
- **Memory caching system** - API responses cached in-memory with 5-minute timeout to reduce API calls
- **Cross-tab synchronization** - Storage events ensure watchlist stays synced across browser tabs

### Animation System
- **Intersection Observer API** - Scroll-triggered animations for performance-optimized viewport detection
- **CSS transitions and transforms** - Hardware-accelerated animations for smooth visual effects
- **Animation queuing system** - Manages complex animation sequences without blocking UI
- **Cursor interaction effects** - Custom hover states and grid interactions

### Search and Filtering
- **Debounced search** - Input throttling prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Multi-criteria filtering** - Genre, language, region, and actor-based filtering capabilities
- **Pagination system** - Load-more functionality for handling large result sets
- **Real-time search suggestions** - Dynamic dropdown with search results preview

### Authentication Strategy
- **Client-side session management** - Modal-based login/register forms with localStorage session tracking
- **Form validation** - JavaScript-based input validation with error messaging
- **Responsive auth flow** - Mobile-optimized modal design with tab switching

## External Dependencies

### APIs
- **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** - Primary data source for movies, TV shows, cast information, and images
- **TMDB Image CDN** - Movie posters, backdrops, and actor photos served from TMDb's content delivery network

### CDN Resources
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0** - Icon library for UI elements (search, navigation, social icons)
- **Google Fonts** (implied) - Typography enhancement for modern font rendering

### Browser APIs
- **Intersection Observer API** - Modern scroll-triggered animation system
- **localStorage API** - Persistent data storage for watchlists and user preferences  
- **Fetch API** - HTTP requests for movie data retrieval
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** - Modern layout systems for responsive design

### Image Assets
- **SVG graphics** - Logo, animated character, and icon assets stored locally
- **Optimized image formats** - Performance-focused asset delivery

The architecture emphasizes performance, responsiveness, and user experience while maintaining simplicity through vanilla JavaScript implementation. The modular design allows for easy feature expansion and maintenance.
